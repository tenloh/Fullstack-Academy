# Pig Latin

- String Manipulation
- Loops

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below) but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.

- Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the of the word.
- Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the of the word.

(There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too, but that should be enough to understand the tests.)

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin> for more details.

## Hints:

Regular Expressions are great but we haven't covered them in depth yet.  Look into using the .indexOf method in your solution and resist using
Regular Expressions.
